During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.'

That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.'

That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.'

That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

Scroll down for more Family and friends of Aaron Siler, a man shot dead by police last month, are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the trigger, Pablo Torres, was erected in Kenosham, Wisconsin 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron': Family friend Kathy Willie\u00a0called the billboard 'disrespectful' and said it should be taken down Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.' Aaron Siler, right, was fatally shot after he 'armed himself with a weapon' after being confronted by officer Pablo Torres, left, on March 14 A car is damaged after a police chase: Siler, who was wanted on an active felony probation and parole warrant, was shot and killed by Torres following a vehicle and foot pursuit Siler, who was wanted on an active felony probation and parole warrant, was shot and killed by Torres following a vehicle and foot pursuit. That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019"}, "summary":

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh.

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.'

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.'

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.' East Midlands Airport said that 'no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item'"}, "summary": {"text": "four - year - old james hayward had his toy gun confiscated at east midlands airport . a four -

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.'

The Foxes host Swansea on Saturday just three points from safety in the Barclays Premier League after back-to-back wins.

On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were \"unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,\" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will \"file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels\" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it \"one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.\" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident. Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska.

On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were \"unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,\" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will \"file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels\" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it \"one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.\" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident. Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska. CNN's Steve Brusk and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report."}, "summary": {"text": "A U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker .

The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing Hull (away) - May 4 Swansea (home) - May 11 Man United (away) - May 17 Sunderland (home) May 20 West Brom (home) - May 24 Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has

The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing Hull (away) - May 4 Swansea (home) - May 11 Man United (away) - May 17 Sunderland (home) May 20 West Brom (home) - May 24 Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has scored 14 Premier League goals this season"}, "summary": {"text": "Henry thinks Arsenal need four players in the summer ' I think he 's in the best form of his career and he 's scoring a lot of goals , but he 's not leading the team to the title yet .

And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.'

When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California. The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California. The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions. Gone With The Wind, which celebrated its 75th anniversary last year, was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 best-selling book about a spoiled Old South socialite, played by Vivien Leigh, and co-starred Clark gable as Rhett Butler Hattie McDaniel (left), Olivia DeHavilland (middle), and Vivien Leigh:\u00a0McDaniel famously became the first African-American actor to be nominated for and win an Academy Award Other top selling items from the auction were a straw hat worn by Leigh that sold for $52,500; the trousers and jacket from a suit worn by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, selling for $55,000; and a black bonnet worn by both Leigh and Olivia De Havilland as Melanie Wilkes, which fetched $30,000.

Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California.

Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

Heritage Auctions offered the gray jacket and skirt, featuring a black zigzag applique, plus more than 150 other items from the Academy Award-winning film at auction on Saturday in Beverly Hills, California. The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and when she gets attacked in the shanty town. Scroll down for video An outfit worn in several scenes of the 1939 film Gone With The Wind by Vivien Leigh as she played Scarlett O'Hara sold for $137,000 at auction on Saturday The dress - a jacket and full skirt ensemble - was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie but has suffered a little with age and has faded to light gray from original slate blue-gray color The outfit has suffered a little with age, however. When Leigh wore it in the movie, it was slate blue-gray but over the years it has faded to light gray. It was one of more than 150 items that were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia. During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20. Tumblin has 'devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,' said Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions.

The child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene.

He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

Scroll down for video A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

Scroll down for video A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

The child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. Scroll down for video A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

Scroll down for video A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

The child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. Scroll down for video A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

The toddler's mother was holding him and another child when he slipped and fell between 10 to 12ft and into the pit on Saturday around 3pm. The child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. Scroll down for video A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5.

He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

The toddler's mother was holding him and another child when he slipped and fell between 10 to 12ft and into the pit on Saturday around 3pm. The child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. Scroll down for video A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5.

He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5.

The child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. Scroll down for video A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

Aaron Siler, 26, was fatally shot after he 'armed himself with a weapon' after being confronted by officer Pablo Torres on March 14. Torres is currently on leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the deadly shooting. In the meantime a billboard, paid for by the Kenosha Professional Police Association, has been erected featuring a photograph of Torres and his dog. 'Thank you for your support, Kenosha,' it reads. Scroll down for more Family and friends of Aaron Siler, a man shot dead by police last month, are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the trigger, Pablo Torres, was erected in Kenosham, Wisconsin 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron': Family friend Kathy Willie\u00a0called the billboard 'disrespectful' and said it should be taken down Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.' Aaron Siler, right, was fatally shot after he 'armed himself with a weapon' after being confronted by officer Pablo Torres, left, on March 14 A car is damaged after a police chase: Siler, who was wanted on an active felony probation and parole warrant, was shot and killed by Torres following a vehicle and foot pursuit Siler, who was wanted on an active felony probation and parole warrant, was shot and killed by Torres following a vehicle and foot pursuit. That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety.

Aaron Siler, 26, was fatally shot after he 'armed himself with a weapon' after being confronted by officer Pablo Torres on March 14. Torres is currently on leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the deadly shooting. In the meantime a billboard, paid for by the Kenosha Professional Police Association, has been erected featuring a photograph of Torres and his dog. 'Thank you for your support, Kenosha,' it reads. Scroll down for more Family and friends of Aaron Siler, a man shot dead by police last month, are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the trigger, Pablo Torres, was erected in Kenosham, Wisconsin 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron': Family friend Kathy Willie\u00a0called the billboard 'disrespectful' and said it should be taken down Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.' Aaron Siler, right, was fatally shot after he 'armed himself with a weapon' after being confronted by officer Pablo Torres, left, on March 14 A car is damaged after a police chase: Siler, who was wanted on an active felony probation and parole warrant, was shot and killed by Torres following a vehicle and foot pursuit Siler, who was wanted on an active felony probation and parole warrant, was shot and killed by Torres following a vehicle and foot pursuit. That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety.

Aaron Siler, 26, was fatally shot after he 'armed himself with a weapon' after being confronted by officer Pablo Torres on March 14. Torres is currently on leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the deadly shooting. In the meantime a billboard, paid for by the Kenosha Professional Police Association, has been erected featuring a photograph of Torres and his dog. 'Thank you for your support, Kenosha,' it reads. Scroll down for more Family and friends of Aaron Siler, a man shot dead by police last month, are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the trigger, Pablo Torres, was erected in Kenosham, Wisconsin 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron': Family friend Kathy Willie\u00a0called the billboard 'disrespectful' and said it should be taken down Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.' Aaron Siler, right, was fatally shot after he 'armed himself with a weapon' after being confronted by officer Pablo Torres, left, on March 14 A car is damaged after a police chase: Siler, who was wanted on an active felony probation and parole warrant, was shot and killed by Torres following a vehicle and foot pursuit Siler, who was wanted on an active felony probation and parole warrant, was shot and killed by Torres following a vehicle and foot pursuit. That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety.

Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

Scroll down for more Family and friends of Aaron Siler, a man shot dead by police last month, are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the trigger, Pablo Torres, was erected in Kenosham, Wisconsin 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron': Family friend Kathy Willie\u00a0called the billboard 'disrespectful' and said it should be taken down Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.'

That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

Scroll down for more Family and friends of Aaron Siler, a man shot dead by police last month, are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the trigger, Pablo Torres, was erected in Kenosham, Wisconsin 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron': Family friend Kathy Willie\u00a0called the billboard 'disrespectful' and said it should be taken down Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.'

That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

Scroll down for more Family and friends of Aaron Siler, a man shot dead by police last month, are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the trigger, Pablo Torres, was erected in Kenosham, Wisconsin 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron': Family friend Kathy Willie\u00a0called the billboard 'disrespectful' and said it should be taken down Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.'

That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified. The investigation into Siler's death continues."}, "summary": {"text": "family and friends of man shot dead by police last month are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the

Scroll down for more Family and friends of Aaron Siler, a man shot dead by police last month, are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the trigger, Pablo Torres, was erected in Kenosham, Wisconsin 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron': Family friend Kathy Willie\u00a0called the billboard 'disrespectful' and said it should be taken down Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.'

That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

Scroll down for more Family and friends of Aaron Siler, a man shot dead by police last month, are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the trigger, Pablo Torres, was erected in Kenosham, Wisconsin 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron': Family friend Kathy Willie\u00a0called the billboard 'disrespectful' and said it should be taken down Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.'

That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

Scroll down for more Family and friends of Aaron Siler, a man shot dead by police last month, are in shock after a billboard featuring the officer who pulled the trigger, Pablo Torres, was erected in Kenosham, Wisconsin 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron': Family friend Kathy Willie\u00a0called the billboard 'disrespectful' and said it should be taken down Siler's family and friends have called the billboard 'disrespectful' and are asking for it be taken down. 'I felt like they were saying thank you for killing Aaron,' said family friend Kathy Willie. She told WISN that Siler's mother started crying when she heard about the billboard. 'Why are they doing this to us?' she asked. The Kenosha Professional Police Association claims that no offence was intended and that the billboard was simply to thank the community for its support. 'The recent incidents in the community have greatly impacted many people including the officer, his family and the entire police department,' the police association said in a statement. 'We have been humbled by the outpouring of support the community has given us and we wanted to simply say thank you for that support.'

That shooting came just 10 days after Torres, responding to a report of a suicidal man, shot 66-year-old Terry Knight, who was armed with two knives. Knight was wounded in the stomach and was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety. Kenosha police asked agents from the state Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate both shootings. The investigation into the shooting of Knight was turned over to District Attorney Robert Zapf's office on March 20, and he determined this month that the shooting was justified.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019"}, "summary": {"text": "nathan hughes on friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out george north sensationally over - turned on appeal . the wasps no 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ` reckless ' for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the welsh lion . hughes was shown a red card for the offence , but dismissal has now been officially rescinded .", "candidates": [{"candidate_id": "cbe9f2efa3fa20d6e7e40f0d65a41af8", "group_id": "ca7e9fc165818e5ba1cf6e9e7ce7474c", "candidate": "nathan hughes", "candidate_start": 0, "candidate_end": 13, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 124, "coreference_cluster": ["hughes", "nathan hughes", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "f296c92e1508ff80dd839740d63f8e53", "group_id": "ca7e9fc165818e5ba1cf6e9e7ce7474c", "candidate": "friday night", "candidate_start": 17, "candidate_end": 29, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 124, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "319554632896a4a4db1c0236629c0fe6", "group_id": "ca7e9fc165818e5ba1cf6e9e7ce7474c", "candidate": "his ban", "candidate_start": 34, "candidate_end": 41, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 124, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "1524f0392e5143254fc4df8720b499b2", "group_id": "ca7e9fc165818e5ba1cf6e9e7ce7474c", "candidate": "george north", "candidate_start": 72, "candidate_end": 84, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 124, "coreference_cluster": ["george north", "the welsh lion"]}, {"candidate_id": "f31de584251d416f96d839f6c90863af", "group_id": "ca7e9fc165818e5ba1cf6e9e7ce7474c", "candidate": "appeal", "candidate_start": 116, "candidate_end": 122, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 124, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "a374160b6995df2aad88366feda41442", "group_id": "ec47d78d3300e67d16706b74cc1563e6", "candidate": "the wasps", "candidate_start": 125, "candidate_end": 134, "sent_start": 125, "sent_end": 305, "coreference_cluster": ["hughes", "nathan hughes", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "87102b078f120e9103ac49f30f9113df", "group_id": "ec47d78d3300e67d16706b74cc1563e6", "candidate": "three matches", "candidate_start": 168, "candidate_end": 181, "sent_start": 125, "sent_end": 305, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "83f0df61adc6698e083f0ef545d2ee9e", "group_id": "ec47d78d3300e67d16706b74cc1563e6", "candidate": "a disciplinary panel", "candidate_start": 190, "candidate_end": 210, "sent_start": 125, "sent_end": 305, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "d921e7ab056e1632eeeee2881ebe2988", "group_id": "ec47d78d3300e67d16706b74cc1563e6", "candidate": "he", "candidate_start": 217, "candidate_end": 219, "sent_start": 125, "sent_end": 305, "coreference_cluster": ["hughes", "nathan hughes", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "2e511f5240c6edb939717406e19435e2", "group_id": "ec47d78d3300e67d16706b74cc1563e6", "candidate": "his knee", "candidate_start": 265, "candidate_end": 273, "sent_start": 125, "sent_end": 305, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "b859a155a52ff7e1c84bae8dfb437511", "group_id": "ec47d78d3300e67d16706b74cc1563e6", "candidate": "the welsh lion", "candidate_start": 289, "candidate_end": 303, "sent_start": 125, "sent_end": 305, "coreference_cluster": ["george north", "the welsh lion"]}, {"candidate_id": "5eaff0f5ab50512448b4d1cc408c050c", "group_id": "f6e07fdd4687b19a483a9d796e1be3c4", "candidate": "hughes", "candidate_start": 306, "candidate_end": 312, "sent_start": 306, "sent_end": 401, "coreference_cluster": ["hughes", "nathan hughes", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "331433f5f5bfcb87f3245469be340468", "group_id": "f6e07fdd4687b19a483a9d796e1be3c4", "candidate": "a red card", "candidate_start": 323, "candidate_end": 333, "sent_start": 306, "sent_end": 401, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "fb324a34bde4c12aaf8caef49f78d86d", "group_id": "f6e07fdd4687b19a483a9d796e1be3c4", "candidate": "the offence", "candidate_start": 338, "candidate_end": 349, "sent_start": 306, "sent_end": 401, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "16de2c71ba86904e836d46091e0fb50c", "group_id": "f6e07fdd4687b19a483a9d796e1be3c4", "candidate": "dismissal", "candidate_start": 356, "candidate_end": 365, "sent_start": 306, "sent_end": 401, "coreference_cluster": []}]}, "references": [{"summarizer_id": "ground-truth", "summarizer_type": "reference", "text": "Nathan Hughes accidentally knocked out George North during Northampton's 52-30 victory against Wasps on March 27.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019"}, "summary": {"text": "the wasps no 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ` reckless ' for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the welsh lion , as he scored a try for northampton on march 27 . hughes was shown a red card for the offence , but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded . nathan hughes 's knee collided with george north 's head as he crossed the line to score for northampton . fiji -

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019"}, "summary": {"text": "nathan hughes had his ban for accidentally knocking out george north . the wasps no 8 was initially suspended for three matches . a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ` reckless ' for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the welsh lion .", "candidates": [{"candidate_id": "5023af76f8025d2d303702299c3a836e", "group_id": "ce8eaaa60e44ad43db73cd9bde48ac58", "candidate": "nathan hughes", "candidate_start": 0, "candidate_end": 13, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 70, "coreference_cluster": ["nathan hughes", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "b7e28f2dc05683243238af45a0c0e2fd", "group_id": "ce8eaaa60e44ad43db73cd9bde48ac58", "candidate": "his ban", "candidate_start": 18, "candidate_end": 25, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 70, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "958f19015ab1b34b030eab653ad7ea14", "group_id": "ce8eaaa60e44ad43db73cd9bde48ac58", "candidate": "george north", "candidate_start": 56, "candidate_end": 68, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 70, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "52bbe649ec454d6e88b3676aeba082df", "group_id": "399906a9664eeb6e01a31329b4b14452", "candidate": "the wasps", "candidate_start": 71, "candidate_end": 80, "sent_start": 71, "sent_end": 129, "coreference_cluster": ["nathan hughes", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "76c78749293a1ec002a0454665d52020", "group_id": "399906a9664eeb6e01a31329b4b14452", "candidate": "three matches", "candidate_start": 114, "candidate_end": 127, "sent_start": 71, "sent_end": 129, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "1b4182f7152ac1b5225e79262b238e75", "group_id": "5c63e76a8f86bb5d2924bb49b153267b", "candidate": "a disciplinary panel", "candidate_start": 130, "candidate_end": 150, "sent_start": 130, "sent_end": 257, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "185199f255844bae322985ed18c36eae", "group_id": "5c63e76a8f86bb5d2924bb49b153267b", "candidate": "he", "candidate_start": 157, "candidate_end": 159, "sent_start": 130, "sent_end": 257, "coreference_cluster": ["nathan hughes", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "0eae8cb2bcee25819a998feb249e5a3f", "group_id": "5c63e76a8f86bb5d2924bb49b153267b", "candidate": "his knee", "candidate_start": 205, "candidate_end": 213, "sent_start": 130, "sent_end": 257, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "7336782af5316f89bfc1da0b7dcc6217", "group_id": "5c63e76a8f86bb5d2924bb49b153267b", "candidate": "the head", "candidate_start": 229, "candidate_end": 237, "sent_start": 130, "sent_end": 257, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "1237b8736f185ea3b53c9c6d3f9b120c", "group_id": "5c63e76a8f86bb5d2924bb49b153267b", "candidate": "the welsh lion", "candidate_start": 241, "candidate_end": 255, "sent_start": 130, "sent_end": 257, "coreference_cluster": []}]}, "references": [{"summarizer_id": "ground-truth", "summarizer_type": "reference", "text": "Nathan Hughes accidentally knocked out George North during Northampton's 52-30 victory against Wasps on March 27.

There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019"}, "summary": {"text": "nathan hughes 's knee collided with george north 's head as he crossed the line to score for northampton . the wasps no 8 was initially suspended for three matches . hughes was shown a red card for the offence , but that dismissal has now been rescinded .", "candidates": [{"candidate_id": "12d545b19aded5fdee1b9e8a6bcbdbe6", "group_id": "320965691a0c7a99309285601e6e0c8c", "candidate": "nathan hughes 's knee", "candidate_start": 0, "candidate_end": 21, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 106, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "686e0ba8891692ffd8471b85fe57b8b5", "group_id": "320965691a0c7a99309285601e6e0c8c", "candidate": "george north 's head", "candidate_start": 36, "candidate_end": 56, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 106, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "d9fd5e9cd0f5f078f1c65950bad7d391", "group_id": "320965691a0c7a99309285601e6e0c8c", "candidate": "he", "candidate_start": 60, "candidate_end": 62, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 106, "coreference_cluster": ["hughes", "nathan hughes 's", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "51127e4bbff942cbee5cabfb3a51e277", "group_id": "320965691a0c7a99309285601e6e0c8c", "candidate": "the line", "candidate_start": 71, "candidate_end": 79, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 106, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "e3ea7c58c1f11e30faac318983e7ac5a", "group_id": "320965691a0c7a99309285601e6e0c8c", "candidate": "northampton", "candidate_start": 93, "candidate_end": 104, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 106, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "5ef35151383f89b1724d223c4cbd49e9", "group_id": "6118bf2782cc2b56f1bad555c3005964", "candidate": "the wasps", "candidate_start": 107, "candidate_end": 116, "sent_start": 107, "sent_end": 165, "coreference_cluster": ["hughes", "nathan hughes 's", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "b981b9688cb8de49290d0532b13423c4", "group_id": "6118bf2782cc2b56f1bad555c3005964", "candidate": "three matches", "candidate_start": 150, "candidate_end": 163, "sent_start": 107, "sent_end": 165, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "c2ea17b2283974f0577d52b36faa91e7", "group_id": "2a4fc9ec68edc8519812f8dc43feb73d", "candidate": "hughes", "candidate_start": 166, "candidate_end": 172, "sent_start": 166, "sent_end": 255, "coreference_cluster": ["hughes", "nathan hughes 's", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "a5bd25763cff0c4ac21d2fa87e395a49", "group_id": "2a4fc9ec68edc8519812f8dc43feb73d", "candidate": "a red card", "candidate_start": 183, "candidate_end": 193, "sent_start": 166, "sent_end": 255, "coreference_cluster": ["a red card", "that dismissal"]}, {"candidate_id": "36959dbf79cc6244bf733ee8c2ca521d", "group_id": "2a4fc9ec68edc8519812f8dc43feb73d", "candidate": "the offence", "candidate_start": 198, "candidate_end": 209, "sent_start": 166, "sent_end": 255, "coreference_cluster": ["collided", "the offence"]}, {"candidate_id": "8c5cdd9df77458c6611384752f507f1c", "group_id": "2a4fc9ec68edc8519812f8dc43feb73d", "candidate": "that dismissal", "candidate_start": 216, "candidate_end": 230, "sent_start": 166, "sent_end": 255, "coreference_cluster": ["a red card", "that dismissal"]}]}, "references": [{"summarizer_id": "ground-truth", "summarizer_type": "reference", "text": "Nathan Hughes accidentally knocked out George North during Northampton's 52-30 victory against Wasps on March 27.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019"}, "summary":

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018reckless\u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin\u2019s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: \u2018Astounded would be an under-statement\u2019, while fly-half Andy Goode added: \u2018Really can\u2019t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.\u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018total joke\u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an \u2018absolute joke\u2019. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club\u2019s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps\u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: \u2018The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.\u2019"}, "summary": {"text": "nathan hughes 's knee collided with george north 's head as he crossed the line . the wasps no 8 was initially suspended for three matches . north was left out cold on the pitch at franklin 's gardens . the ban was thrown out , as the appeal lodged by wasps .", "candidates": [{"candidate_id": "f841ba534428a1d3a9df134296aea31f", "group_id": "5a9385feb359a178d4089d3de0c8093f", "candidate": "nathan hughes 's knee", "candidate_start": 0, "candidate_end": 21, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 81, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "bc9bf1578f89376d47b1be94372ec05f", "group_id": "5a9385feb359a178d4089d3de0c8093f", "candidate": "george north 's head", "candidate_start": 36, "candidate_end": 56, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 81, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "17119e5621cc18593284b8bf28fa494e", "group_id": "5a9385feb359a178d4089d3de0c8093f", "candidate": "he", "candidate_start": 60, "candidate_end": 62, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 81, "coreference_cluster": ["george north 's", "north", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "08bb63a2dae3798982ade0690ae353bf", "group_id": "5a9385feb359a178d4089d3de0c8093f", "candidate": "the line", "candidate_start": 71, "candidate_end": 79, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 81, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "76b3bd4aae3ad4eeff60945fb93e83f7", "group_id": "e07f7ea63d06821932d67d90aa6a823f", "candidate": "the wasps", "candidate_start": 82, "candidate_end": 91, "sent_start": 82, "sent_end": 140, "coreference_cluster": ["george north 's", "north", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "7fbcb047690a94fa32fa1d14be6ffc0b", "group_id": "e07f7ea63d06821932d67d90aa6a823f", "candidate": "three matches", "candidate_start": 125, "candidate_end": 138, "sent_start": 82, "sent_end": 140, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "2113b89c561fd91df148a9a1491266c2", "group_id": "c127672db2b706d0d58191721f71e4f3", "candidate": "north", "candidate_start": 141, "candidate_end": 146, "sent_start": 141, "sent_end": 202, "coreference_cluster": ["george north 's", "north", "the wasps no 8"]}, {"candidate_id": "2864dfed7b5ed180333bf2eb55c12212", "group_id": "c127672db2b706d0d58191721f71e4f3", "candidate": "the pitch", "candidate_start": 168, "candidate_end": 177, "sent_start": 141, "sent_end": 202, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "d687b3bac4c7cd0049e63746eeb58fcd", "group_id": "c127672db2b706d0d58191721f71e4f3", "candidate": "franklin 's gardens", "candidate_start": 181, "candidate_end": 200, "sent_start": 141, "sent_end": 202, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "a5d88ad19217c99e857632566404c79b", "group_id": "f0166064ad114e3acd9d32c1722a6115", "candidate": "the ban", "candidate_start": 203, "candidate_end": 210, "sent_start": 203, "sent_end": 259, "coreference_cluster": ["suspended", "the ban"]}, {"candidate_id": "8d47ef8c7b1e67863657777f9c8ea1f7", "group_id": "f0166064ad114e3acd9d32c1722a6115", "candidate": "the appeal", "candidate_start": 231, "candidate_end": 241, "sent_start": 203, "sent_end": 259, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "1d3d7e80bef65686189e48af26d19472", "group_id": "f0166064ad114e3acd9d32c1722a6115", "candidate": "wasps", "candidate_start": 252, "candidate_end": 257, "sent_start": 203, "sent_end": 259, "coreference_cluster": ["wasps"]}]}, "references": [{"summarizer_id": "ground-truth", "summarizer_type": "reference", "text": "Nathan Hughes accidentally knocked out George North during Northampton's 52-30 victory against Wasps on March 27.

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.' East Midlands Airport said that 'no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item'"}, "summary": {"text": "james hayward had his toy gun confiscated at east midlands airport . a four - year - old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk . dad phil has labelled the security checks ` ludicrous ' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation .", "candidates": [{"candidate_id": "b8b68a6e76b337e12ae769801191bc87", "group_id": "915cd79c0ea0de4902dd64626140e990", "candidate": "james hayward", "candidate_start": 0, "candidate_end": 13, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 68, "coreference_cluster": ["a four - year - old boy", "james hayward"]}, {"candidate_id": "13ec619d77f6aae386e22eb05a400ea8", "group_id": "915cd79c0ea0de4902dd64626140e990", "candidate": "his toy gun", "candidate_start": 18, "candidate_end": 29, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 68, "coreference_cluster": ["his plastic nerf gun", "his toy gun"]}, {"candidate_id": "dabd6dc3d2f15310779d10b6dfff74cf", "group_id": "915cd79c0ea0de4902dd64626140e990", "candidate": "east midlands airport", "candidate_start": 45, "candidate_end": 66, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 68, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "50ae8ad61afb28ef035265d8a4906842", "group_id": "d41cae37c1cc50e50e05c224e58cf1d9", "candidate": "a four - year - old boy", "candidate_start": 69, "candidate_end": 92, "sent_start": 69, "sent_end": 212, "coreference_cluster": ["a four - year - old boy", "james hayward"]}, {"candidate_id": "e77dd8d45ce7c41e244d7a01dd433a42", "group_id": "d41cae37c1cc50e50e05c224e58cf1d9", "candidate": "airport security", "candidate_start": 108, "candidate_end": 124, "sent_start": 69, "sent_end": 212, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "489f10bffdd2c400bea0892f748a5498", "group_id": "d41cae37c1cc50e50e05c224e58cf1d9", "candidate": "his plastic nerf gun", "candidate_start": 154, "candidate_end": 174, "sent_start": 69, "sent_end": 212, "coreference_cluster": ["his plastic nerf gun", "his toy gun"]}, {"candidate_id": "8b8d3824d0ccc5212699dd1d17b9bff0", "group_id": "d41cae37c1cc50e50e05c224e58cf1d9", "candidate": "it", "candidate_start": 181, "candidate_end": 183, "sent_start": 69, "sent_end": 212, "coreference_cluster": ["his plastic nerf gun", "his toy gun"]}, {"candidate_id": "59ff7f70ec0e85ea6def99e92e4554fd", "group_id": "0f7d383777b4b5e3e91b493c22ed374d", "candidate": "dad phil", "candidate_start": 213, "candidate_end": 221, "sent_start": 213, "sent_end": 320, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "65915558d8d332fbece1842237ed16ce", "group_id": "0f7d383777b4b5e3e91b493c22ed374d", "candidate": "the security checks", "candidate_start": 235, "candidate_end": 254, "sent_start": 213, "sent_end": 320, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "5156396eaade966a3e155ea0e7e5df36", "group_id": "0f7d383777b4b5e3e91b493c22ed374d", "candidate": "staff", "candidate_start": 288, "candidate_end": 293, "sent_start": 213, "sent_end": 320, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "dcc589b5a125b2c0ec34897e01d2b08a", "group_id": "0f7d383777b4b5e3e91b493c22ed374d", "candidate": "the situation", "candidate_start": 305, "candidate_end": 318, "sent_start": 213, "sent_end": 320, "coreference_cluster": []}]}, "references": [{"summarizer_id": "ground-truth", "summarizer_type": "reference", "text": "James Hayward was flying with parents Phil and Hazel to Lanzarote.

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child.

Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.'

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.'

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.'

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.' East Midlands Airport said that 'no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item'"}, "summary": {"text": "james hayward arrived at east midlands airport with his parents . the four -

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.' East Midlands Airport said that 'no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item'"}, "summary": {"text": "james hayward had his plastic nerf gun confiscated at east midlands airport . the four -

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.' East Midlands Airport said that 'no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item'"}, "summary": {"text": "four - year - old james hayward had his toy gun confiscated at east midlands airport . a four -

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents, Phil, 44, and Hazel, 38, with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote. But  security officers, who were described as 'over-zealous' by the boy's father, then took exception to James's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system's X-ray machines. They demanded he hand it over, and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child. Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation. Mr Hayward, a software engineer, said: 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old. 'We were so late by this point I didn't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we didn't want to miss our flight. 'I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday. We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter. 'I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time. 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid. Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote, the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers, and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays. East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Defending the decision a spokeswoman said: 'The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government. 'This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item.' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport, and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such 'toy guns,' the prohibited list does include 'replica or model guns.' East Midlands Airport said that 'no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item'"}, "summary": {"text": "james hayward had arrived at east midlands airport with his parents , phil , 44 , and hazel , 38 , with his brightly coloured toy -

On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were \"unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,\" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will \"file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels\" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it \"one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.\" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident. Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other, both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska.

On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were \"unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,\" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will \"file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels\" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it \"one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.\" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident.

The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were \"unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,\" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will \"file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels\" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it \"one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.\" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident.

On Tuesday, a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker. The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland. The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot's actions were \"unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed,\" Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said. Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off, according to a Defense Ministry spokesman. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number. An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false. Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will \"file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels\" with Russia. This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27.  A year ago, a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific, according to U.S. officials who called it \"one of the most dangerous close passes in decades.\" The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident.

The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing Hull (away) - May 4 Swansea (home) - May 11 Man United (away) - May 17 Sunderland (home) May 20 West Brom (home) - May 24 Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has

The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing Hull (away) - May 4 Swansea (home) - May 11 Man United (away) - May 17 Sunderland (home) May 20 West Brom (home) - May 24 Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has scored 14 Premier League goals this season"}, "summary": {"text": "the frenchman believes arsenal need a goalkeeper , centre back , defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of

You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league.

They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has

The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing Hull (away) - May 4 Swansea (home) - May 11 Man United (away) - May 17 Sunderland (home) May 20 West Brom (home) - May 24 Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has scored 14 Premier League goals this season"}, "summary": {"text": "arsenal drew 0 - 0 with chelsea at stamford bridge on saturday . sky sports pundit thierry henry questioned arsenal 's transfer business . henry said the gunners need to buy four players to win the league . he said they need a goalkeeper , centre back , defensive midfielder and striker .", "candidates": [{"candidate_id": "85d7f96a0b4b3fd9528cea4a1ec40053", "group_id": "ff08da361ce4f5202ca0098ae8ada055", "candidate": "arsenal", "candidate_start": 0, "candidate_end": 7, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 64, "coreference_cluster": ["arsenal", "arsenal 's", "the gunners"]}, {"candidate_id": "9382d76812d9ad3ce3a9df04183e5441", "group_id": "ff08da361ce4f5202ca0098ae8ada055", "candidate": "chelsea", "candidate_start": 24, "candidate_end": 31, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 64, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "0cb6d42b6e7cf05278aebb1d9dd296a6", "group_id": "ff08da361ce4f5202ca0098ae8ada055", "candidate": "stamford bridge", "candidate_start": 35, "candidate_end": 50, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 64, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "df71a87a60736514edf795fb8404fc73", "group_id": "ff08da361ce4f5202ca0098ae8ada055", "candidate": "saturday", "candidate_start": 54, "candidate_end": 62, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 64, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "d4fce47da9bacb6aae7c5895bba44096", "group_id": "32e8bd8b80cb8cc3d43b2167ce0d2c95", "candidate": "sky sports pundit thierry henry", "candidate_start": 65, "candidate_end": 96, "sent_start": 65, "sent_end": 138, "coreference_cluster": ["henry", "sky sports pundit thierry henry"]}, {"candidate_id": "cc6c572525fda95e6e90b237db3c2eeb", "group_id": "32e8bd8b80cb8cc3d43b2167ce0d2c95", "candidate": "arsenal 's transfer business", "candidate_start": 108, "candidate_end": 136, "sent_start": 65, "sent_end": 138, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "23293b903c82a8e1a802721c26d96be6", "group_id": "0792ccddc9d28c4be65b2332b9e4011e", "candidate": "henry", "candidate_start": 139, "candidate_end": 144, "sent_start": 139, "sent_end": 206, "coreference_cluster": ["henry", "sky sports pundit thierry henry"]}, {"candidate_id": "ddf506eac6d27708fd78f50eb11aef4f", "group_id": "0792ccddc9d28c4be65b2332b9e4011e", "candidate": "the gunners", "candidate_start": 150, "candidate_end": 161, "sent_start": 139, "sent_end": 206, "coreference_cluster": ["arsenal", "arsenal 's", "the gunners"]}, {"candidate_id": "e01b0475c82861907d9d6badab653a7e", "group_id": "0792ccddc9d28c4be65b2332b9e4011e", "candidate": "four players", "candidate_start": 174, "candidate_end": 186, "sent_start": 139, "sent_end": 206, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "5ff11dde682cf115b4df96e610d9499e", "group_id": "0792ccddc9d28c4be65b2332b9e4011e", "candidate": "the league", "candidate_start": 194, "candidate_end": 204, "sent_start": 139, "sent_end": 206, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "10f6cfb6f1a15ee3571ec44cf71f5c15", "group_id": "26bcf3768cd9211305c22c60cd3e4847", "candidate": "he", "candidate_start": 207, "candidate_end": 209, "sent_start": 207, "sent_end": 288, "coreference_cluster": ["henry", "sky sports pundit thierry henry"]}, {"candidate_id": "75debfd5dc4f5da60071cbf7d446c36b", "group_id": "26bcf3768cd9211305c22c60cd3e4847", "candidate": "they", "candidate_start": 215, "candidate_end": 219, "sent_start": 207, "sent_end": 288, "coreference_cluster": ["arsenal", "arsenal 's", "the gunners"]}, {"candidate_id": "a035989be0458290921dd94ba52c11d5", "group_id": "26bcf3768cd9211305c22c60cd3e4847", "candidate": "a goalkeeper , centre back , defensive midfielder", "candidate_start": 225, "candidate_end": 274, "sent_start": 207, "sent_end": 288, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "0538438237634f77b57171e4a24159e6", "group_id": "26bcf3768cd9211305c22c60cd3e4847", "candidate": "striker", "candidate_start": 279, "candidate_end": 286, "sent_start": 207, "sent_end": 288, "coreference_cluster": []}]}, "references": [{"summarizer_id": "ground-truth", "summarizer_type": "reference", "text": "Thierry Henry hit out at Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud after Chelsea draw.

The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing Hull (away) - May 4 Swansea (home) - May 11 Man United (away) - May 17 Sunderland (home) May 20 West Brom (home) - May 24 Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry Giroud, pictured during Arsenal's match against Chelsea, has scored 14 Premier League goals this season"}, "summary": {"text": "thierry henry has criticised arsenal 's transfer dealings in the transfer window . the sky sports pundit says the gunners need four players to win the title . henry was speaking after arsenal 's goalless draw with chelsea . arsenal are third in the premier league , level on points with manchester city .", "candidates": [{"candidate_id": "436b4c373fbcb5bba88ba2198915bb9e", "group_id": "636ede17a44e9200f49e99ab25f52ecf", "candidate": "thierry henry", "candidate_start": 0, "candidate_end": 13, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 82, "coreference_cluster": ["henry", "the sky sports pundit", "thierry henry"]}, {"candidate_id": "1b6fcf2bd94ad74de3f3274c2db0d3c7", "group_id": "636ede17a44e9200f49e99ab25f52ecf", "candidate": "arsenal 's transfer dealings", "candidate_start": 29, "candidate_end": 57, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 82, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "98e465f721cad22356c8ab28df4733fd", "group_id": "636ede17a44e9200f49e99ab25f52ecf", "candidate": "the transfer window", "candidate_start": 61, "candidate_end": 80, "sent_start": 0, "sent_end": 82, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "6f99c17dc071e4b5eb1da7bd78c1439f", "group_id": "34c9755d8384d69b2ede9940b736e981", "candidate": "the sky sports pundit", "candidate_start": 83, "candidate_end": 104, "sent_start": 83, "sent_end": 158, "coreference_cluster": ["henry", "the sky sports pundit", "thierry henry"]}, {"candidate_id": "464ca142b76a17bcd5f11785a93836da", "group_id": "34c9755d8384d69b2ede9940b736e981", "candidate": "the gunners", "candidate_start": 110, "candidate_end": 121, "sent_start": 83, "sent_end": 158, "coreference_cluster": ["arsenal", "arsenal 's", "the gunners"]}, {"candidate_id": "96c6b9fd857ad9eafb7ea269e03609dc", "group_id": "34c9755d8384d69b2ede9940b736e981", "candidate": "four players", "candidate_start": 127, "candidate_end": 139, "sent_start": 83, "sent_end": 158, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "3495ae06824d83ec7a799389629d0af4", "group_id": "34c9755d8384d69b2ede9940b736e981", "candidate": "the title", "candidate_start": 147, "candidate_end": 156, "sent_start": 83, "sent_end": 158, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "3e26269c517079e6b07aa90a3030418b", "group_id": "6e25d2d0edac246940165d58a9ea4772", "candidate": "henry", "candidate_start": 159, "candidate_end": 164, "sent_start": 159, "sent_end": 223, "coreference_cluster": ["henry", "the sky sports pundit", "thierry henry"]}, {"candidate_id": "8bd460a206cc055f74d37b67d09cbda2", "group_id": "6e25d2d0edac246940165d58a9ea4772", "candidate": "arsenal 's goalless", "candidate_start": 184, "candidate_end": 203, "sent_start": 159, "sent_end": 223, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "1fe03a099ab4173776db70e786e8fb74", "group_id": "6e25d2d0edac246940165d58a9ea4772", "candidate": "chelsea", "candidate_start": 214, "candidate_end": 221, "sent_start": 159, "sent_end": 223, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "6944834a933141e4956600c1a89f9663", "group_id": "aa3f081675a1d649e63aa67152979e32", "candidate": "arsenal", "candidate_start": 224, "candidate_end": 231, "sent_start": 224, "sent_end": 304, "coreference_cluster": ["arsenal", "arsenal 's", "the gunners"]}, {"candidate_id": "438c6fd2d62631a3705251187f49d20d", "group_id": "aa3f081675a1d649e63aa67152979e32", "candidate": "the premier league", "candidate_start": 245, "candidate_end": 263, "sent_start": 224, "sent_end": 304, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "8c50cc37f5274e9a0b5ecd8cf79bf1f7", "group_id": "aa3f081675a1d649e63aa67152979e32", "candidate": "level", "candidate_start": 266, "candidate_end": 271, "sent_start": 224, "sent_end": 304, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "fab381279aa3e54debf4f4b208190cd7", "group_id": "aa3f081675a1d649e63aa67152979e32", "candidate": "points", "candidate_start": 275, "candidate_end": 281, "sent_start": 224, "sent_end": 304, "coreference_cluster": []}, {"candidate_id": "a81e1e6eada31f8ed64ee636a244b613", "group_id": "aa3f081675a1d649e63aa67152979e32", "candidate": "manchester city", "candidate_start": 287, "candidate_end": 302, "sent_start": 224, "sent_end": 304, "coreference_cluster": []}]}, "references": [{"summarizer_id": "ground-truth", "summarizer_type": "reference", "text": "Thierry Henry hit out at Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud after Chelsea draw.

The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing Hull (away) - May 4 Swansea (home) - May 11 Man United (away) - May 17 Sunderland (home) May 20 West Brom (home) - May 24 Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league.

Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker.

'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league.
